1)The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript.

normal programming language double vertical bar (||) we use to do logical OR , logical or is use to combine two or more expressions . it return tru if one condition are tru , it return false if all of condition are false,
in typeScript single vertical bar (|) we use to union type , union type allows a variable to hold a values of multiple possible types .
same goes to 
normal programming language double ampersend (&&) we use to do logical AND , logical or is use to combine two or more expressions , it return true if all are condition true , it return false if false if one or more condition are false ,
in typeScript singel ambersend (&) we use to intersection type , intersection type allows to a value to be of multiple types
